# MetaRenderer (MSAA and HDR sample)

this is a simple HDR and MSAA implementation extracted from Meta Renderer

if you have previous version of Meta Renderer such as Meta Renderer 1.5, remember to update the shader files and convars. the advised value for r_hdr_explosure is 5.0 and r_hdr_darkness is 3.5.
